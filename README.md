# LeetCode

[![LeetCode Stats](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/mrgrigri?theme=light)](https://leetcode.com/u/mrgrigri/)

This is my personal repo to track my LeetCode[^1] progress[^2]. Please don't judge me too harshly as I am not a backend developer. All of my work has been frontend development and my philosophy is: "If you have to worry about runtime and memory usage, you should call an API!".

## Development

I am using a combination of Babel[^3] and Quokka.js[^4] inside of Visual Studio Code[^5]. Babel is needed for Quokka.js to run and VSCode has a plugin[^6] that will run the code locally inside of the editor. Quokka.js is not free and requires a purchase to run.
